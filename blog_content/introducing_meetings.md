At Tuft, we’re all about making group communication effortless and impactful, and today, we’re thrilled to unveil our latest game-changer: **Tuft’s Meetings**. Designed to break the barriers of traditional video conferencing, this new feature empowers educators, club organizers, community leaders, and creators to connect with their groups—big or small—without limits. Say goodbye to participant caps, time restrictions, and disjointed tools. Tuft’s Meetings is here to redefine how your community comes together.

## Why Meetings Matter

Communities thrive on connection, and sometimes, nothing beats the power of face-to-face interaction. Whether you’re hosting an online class, a town hall, a webinar for thousands, or a quick team huddle, Tuft’s Meetings gives you the freedom to make it happen—your way. Built with scalability and community needs in mind, this isn’t just a video tool; it’s a hub for meaningful engagement, seamlessly woven into Tuft’s broader platform.

## What’s New with Tuft’s Meetings?

- **Free Forever**: No premium plans needed. Tuft delivers unlimited meetings—participants, time, and sessions—at zero cost.
- **Community-First Design**: While other platforms lean corporate, Tuft is crafted for communities—think schools, hobby groups, or massive clubs with thousands of members.
