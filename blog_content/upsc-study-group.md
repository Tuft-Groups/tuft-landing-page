In the competitive world of UPSC preparation, effective study groups can make the difference between success and failure. However, managing these groups efficiently has long been a challenge for both mentors and aspirants. While platforms like Telegram have served as the default choice, their limitations have become increasingly apparent as study groups grow in size and complexity.

## The Current UPSC Study Group Landscape

Most UPSC study groups currently operate through a patchwork of different applications:

- Telegram for daily updates and communication
- Google Drive for storing and sharing study materials
- Google Meet or Zoom for webinars and discussions
- Payment apps like PhonePe for collecting fees

This fragmented approach creates numerous pain points:

1. **Information overload**: Critical updates get buried under conversations
2. **Resource disorganization**: Study materials become difficult to locate
3. **Platform switching**: Constant toggling between apps disrupts focus
4. **Payment tracking**: Manual verification of fees becomes cumbersome
5. **Limited structure**: Flat conversation models make organization impossible

## Introducing Tuft: The All-in-One UPSC Group Management Solution

- **Feed**: A dedicated space where administrators can post daily current affairs updates, important announcements, and study schedules. Students can engage through comments, creating meaningful discussions around specific topics.
- **Chat**: A general communication area where students can freely interact, ask questions, and collaborate on preparation strategies.
- **Chat Threads**: Long discussions remain organized through threaded conversations, ensuring that important exchanges don't get lost in the general chat flow.

### Centralized Resource Management

The **Files** feature serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for UPSC preparation:
