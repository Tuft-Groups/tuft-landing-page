In the ever-evolving world of community management, Tuft continues to innovate with tools designed to make group communication seamless and productive. Today, we’re excited to introduce a powerful new **Chat feature** that takes community engagement to the next level. Whether you’re managing an educational group, a webinar series, a town community, or a content creator hub, this update is built to foster connection while keeping things organized.

## Engagement: The Heart of a Thriving Community

At Tuft, we believe that a strong community isn’t just about sharing information—it’s about sparking conversations and building relationships. Engagement is the key to keeping members connected and invested, and our new Chat feature is designed with that in mind. While our Feed remains the go-to spot for admin-led announcements, the Chat opens up a space where _every member_ can jump in, share their thoughts, and keep the community buzzing.

## Say Hello to Chat Threads

The cornerstone of this update is our **Chat threads** feature. Now, when someone sends a message, you can reply directly to it and create a dedicated thread. This keeps discussions tidy and focused—no more scrolling through a mess of unrelated replies to follow a conversation. Whether it’s a quick question, a lively debate, or a collaborative brainstorm, threads make it easy for everyone to stay on the same page.

## Open to All, Controlled by You

Unlike the Feed, where only admins can post, the Chat is a free-for-all space where **anyone can send a message**. This opens the door to more dynamic interactions—members can ask questions, share ideas, or just chat with one another, driving engagement across the board. And don’t worry, admins: you’re still in charge. If the Chat gets too noisy or off-topic, you can **disable it with a single tap**, giving you full control over the community vibe.

## More Than Just Words

The Chat isn’t limited to text alone. Members can send **photos, documents, and more**, making it a versatile tool for collaboration. Share a quick snapshot from an event, drop a PDF with extra resources, or upload anything else that keeps your community connected. It’s all about giving members the freedom to express themselves however they choose.

## Why It Matters

This update builds on Tuft’s mission to make group communication both _easy_ and _organized_. While the Feed keeps announcements clear and structured, the Chat brings a new layer of interactivity that complements it perfectly. It’s a balance of order and energy—admins can lead with authority, and members can engage with each other in real time. Plus, with the ability to share files and media, the Chat doubles as a hub for creativity and collaboration.

## How to Get Started

The Chat feature is rolling out now and available to all Tuft users **at no extra cost**—just like everything else we offer. Dive in, explore the threads, and see how it transforms your community. Whether you’re rallying a study group, hosting a webinar Q&A, or connecting with your audience as a creator, this is your space to make it happen.

At Tuft, we’re committed to empowering communities with tools that work for you. The Chat feature is just the latest step in that journey, and we can’t wait to hear how it brings your group to life. Let us know what you think—and happy chatting!
